Then customize the query to produce additional output. 
for example:
What is the most common state that the sample customers live in?
How many transactions end in an even or odd integer?
How many transactions were face to face?

Create 5 to 7 questions you can code for to analyze the data for a response

OR

Strip the script and rebuild it to create a report with object data of your choosing 
with 5-7 data elements in each record with a minimum of 20 records and 3-5 
questions you can use to analyze the data.

1.Log in to your Repl Account

2.Create new repl

3.Use python configuration in repl

4.Paste the script into main.py and run

This will run the script and generate the data we will aggregate/ transform

5.After you run this you will see a csv file generate- check the contents to make sure it compiled correctly

6.Save the code from main.py in a separate file called script.py

7.Copy the code from query.py and paste it into main.py and execute it.

You should see results from querying the data.
